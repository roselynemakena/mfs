1. Which automation tool to use for native mobile app
and web app?
a) Which tools would I prefer to use in these situations
 - For a native mobile application, I would consider using Appium if the tests I want
 to be done are black-box type of tests. However, if white-box is preferable, I would choose a tool such as 
espresso or kaspresso

b) How to know if we are testing all devices from a tester's viewpoint
- It is generally very difficult to know that for sure testers are covering 
100% of all devices - because new devices are being manufactured every single
day. However, from a testing standpoint, we can aim for the largest coverage possible by either using
mobile simulators or device farms that offer a large variety of test devices
that range from screen size, memory size, OS versions etc - To cover as many
devices as possible.

2. Role of emulators and Simulators in testing
Simulators come in handy when:
- As a tester, you do not have access to a real device 
of a particular specification, an emulator can be used in place of a real device.
- When doing quick tests that require several devices to run in parallel, emulators
can be used since they mainly depend on the computers capability.

3. What manual testing to conduct before a production release to feel confident
- Tests that require visual verification are done manually - for example, logo positioning, colors, image
locations
- Tests that affect that specific feature should be done manually by performing required 
smoke tests
- Incase there isn't enough bandwidth/time to write automation scripts before the release, then manual 
tests can be used to verify the changes, pending the automation suite to be ready.

4. How to ensure a new QA hire can work successfully in the company
- Give new engineers a good onboarding from the onset to give them a head-start
before starting their role
- Ensure there is proper documentation that is updated regularly - for their 
reference
- Have an open policy ensuring that the "go-to" people are known and open to
help whenever required
- Have a good culture and team spirit to promote good working relations
